-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tools to test for the following the SSH authentications.

public key authentication
host-based authentication
password authentication

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage: ssh-test.py [-h] -a {0,1,2} USER [HOST]

SSH authentication test.

positional arguments:
  USER        the user for public key and password authentication.
  HOST        the host to perform the SSH test, for host-based authenticaion,
              the host name must be in FQDN. default: localhost.localdomain

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -a {0,1,2}  the authentication type, 0: public key, 1: password, 2: host-
              based.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manual test cases:

public key authentication:
	Run ssh command to do the test
	Require: ssh, store user public key in authorized_keys
	Steps to test:
		1) run ssh command: 
			ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey \
			HOST /bin/sh -c exit
		2) check the return code: echo $?
	Expected result:
		Test ok on return code = 0, otherwise test failed.		

host-based authentication:
	Run ssh command to do the test
	Require: ssh
	Steps to test:
		1) run ssh command: 
			ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o PreferredAuthentications=hostbased \
			HOST /bin/sh -c exit
		2) check the return code: echo $?
	Expected result:
		Test ok on return code = 0, otherwise test failed.

password authentication:
	Use sshpass tool to do the test 
	Require: sshpass, ssh, user password stored in the PASSWORDFILE.
	Steps to test:
		1) run sshpass command: 
			sshpass -f PASSWORDFILE ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
			-o PreferredAuthentications=password USER@HOST /bin/sh -c exit
		2) check the return code: echo $?
    Expected result:
        Test ok on return code = 0, otherwise test failed.
